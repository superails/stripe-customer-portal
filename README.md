The API call is pretty simple to [create a
product](https://stripe.com/docs/api/products/create). We create the product by
passing in a name and any optional arguments like description images or a URL.

```rb
Stripe::Product.create(name: 'starter')
```

Prices define how much and how often to charge for products, including the
product cost, which currency to use, and if the price is recurring, the billing
interval. When we [create a price](https://stripe.com/docs/api/prices/create),
we assign it to the product and specify the unit amount, currency, and optional
interval.

```rb
Stripe::Price.create(
  product: 'prod_xxx',
  unit_amount: 500,
  currency: 'usd',
  recurring: {
    interval: 'month'
  },
  lookup_key: 'starter',
)
```

If you hard code the prices on your pricing page and decide to change the
service's cost later, typically, the process is manual, and you'd need to
deploy new code.  Instead of managing price changes with a deploy, you can use
this awesome new feature called
[`lookup_key`](https://stripe.com/docs/api/prices/create#create_price-lookup_key).
The key allows you to refer to the key in your pricing page and [swap out the
price later with
`transfer_lookup_key`](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/prices-guide#managing-prices)
without changing the hardcoded prices.

You can render different prices in the front end, then use the rendered price to bill
the customers.

In the response, we'll see the ID of the price which we can use to reference it later.

We can also list prices by their `lookup_key` to get back a list of prices
given an array of `lookup_keys`.

```rb
Stripe::Price.list(lookup_keys: ['starter'])
```

Now that we've modeled our business and we can create products and prices.
Let's get into the core of the demo: redirecting to the customer portal.

Concerning the database: we store the email address, hashed password, the plan
for the customer which is the `lookup_key` for our Price. The Stripe Customer
ID and the Subscription status in the database. The Subscription status allows
us to provision access and control whether the user has access or not.

```rb
# db/schema.rb
  create_table "users", force: :cascade do |t|
    t.string "email"
    t.string "password_digest"
    t.string "plan" # lookup_key
    t.string "stripe_customer_id"
    t.string "session_token"
    t.datetime "created_at", precision: 6, null: false
    t.datetime "updated_at", precision: 6, null: false
    t.string "subscription_status", default: "incomplete"
    t.index ["email"], name: "index_users_on_email", unique: true
    t.index ["stripe_customer_id"], name: "index_users_on_stripe_customer_id", unique: true
  end
```

From the `dashboard.html.erb` layout, we want to add our button that will
redirect to the customer portal.

```html
<form action="/customer_portal_sessions" method="POST">
  <input type="hidden" name="authenticity_token" value="<%= form_authenticity_token %>">
  <button>Manage Billing</button>
</form>
```

Next we need to create a route that will create a Customer Portal. This is done in a new controller.

```sh
rails generate controller CustomerPortalSessions
```

This will be the controller that contains our redirect.

We need to pull the customer ID out of the database. It might be stored in
Firebase or some external database, but we want to pass the Stripe customer ID
for the authenticated customer. In Rails, we access the authenticated user
through `current_user`. `current_user` here is an instance of a `User` model.


```rb
def create
  portal_session = Stripe::BillingPortal::Session.create(
    customer: current_user.stripe_customer_id,
    return_url: 'http://localhost:3000/episodes'
  )
  redirect_to portal_session.url
end
```

The portal session has a property called the `url`, and that is where we want
to redirect to. In Rails, we can call the `redirect_to` method and pass it the
URL of the session.

Note that in some examples, the URL for the billing portal session might be
returned to the client as JSON, and then the redirect happens client-side.

Either approach is fine, as long as you're confident you're only creating
BillingPortal Sessions for authenticated users.

The last thing we need to do is define the route so that POST requests to
`/customer_portal_sessions` will use our new controller action. In
`config/routes.rb`, we add:

```rb
resources :customer_portal_sessions, only: [:create]
```

We only need to support the `create` action for this controller.

Now we can test this out by restarting the server `rails s` loading our page
`http://localhost:3000/episodes` and clicking on "Manage Billing" to redirect
to the billing portal.

Try changing between plans; try updating your payment method
with `4242424242424242` or `4000002500003155` to experiment
with secure customer authentication.

You can set a new default payment method. You can also switch back to the old
payment method and make that your default. Review the billing history.

Try canceling your plan to end the customer lifecycle.

After heading back to the demo in the browser, you'll notice that the
subscription status hasn't changed. The next step is to update the webhook
handler to provision and de-provision access based on actions taken in the
customer portal.

### Automate provisioning and de-provisioning [ðŸŽ¬](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8H6awDJVpM&t=817s)

From Step 3 in [integrating the customer
portal](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/integrating-customer-portal#webhooks)
guide, it's time to listen to webhooks to receive updates to customers'
subscriptions and payment methods.

When subscriptions are changing -- upgraded or downgraded or
cancelled, we want to be notified of that to update our
database. Here we have a couple of different event types
`customer.subscription.updated` and
`customer.subscription.deleted` are the two types we listen to
in this demo, but you might also want to listen to the payment
method being attached or detached and the customer is
updated if you want to know when the customer changes which
payment method is set as default.

There are a [few](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks/build)
[great](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks/signatures) [guides
ðŸŽ¬](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYSLhriIZaA) for working with webhooks
that walk through full code examples about building webhook handlers. We're
going to start from something very much like the example with Sinatra, we also
have a Stripe Developer Office hours
[episode ðŸŽ¬](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYSLhriIZaA) all about webhooks. If
you're curious about how to implement webhooks, go check out those resources.

For now, we want to ensure access is provisioned to the correct product and
that we're canceling subscriptions and removing access when the customer
chooses to cancel.

You can start a Stripe listener, which creates a direct connection between
Stripe and your local machine so that when events happen on your Stripe
account, your local webhook handler receives them. There's another Stripe
Developer Office hours [episode
ðŸŽ¬](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Psq5N5C-FGo) all about the Stripe CLI and
how you can use it to build and test your Stripe integration.

```sh
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/webhooks
```

We have a `WebhooksController` already created and `resources :webhooks`
already setup in `routes.rb`.

We're going to update our webhook handler to add support for
`customer.subscription.updated` and `customer.subscription.deleted`.

We first extract the subscription from the event data (`event.data.object`)
then lookup the User by their Stripe Customer ID.

Then we update the user object to update the subscription status to the status
of the subscription, as shown in the webhook event.

Then update the plan to be the value set as the price's `lookup_key`.

```rb
when 'customer.subscription.updated', 'customer.subscription.deleted'
  subscription = event.data.object
  @user = User.find_by(stripe_customer_id: subscription.customer)
  @user.update(
    subscription_status: subscription.status,
    plan: subscription.items.data[0].price.lookup_key
  )
end
```

Note this works because we know we're only using one plan per subscription, so
we can be confident that we can reach in and grab the first item in the list
(`subscription.items.data[0]`), and its `lookup_key` will be one of `starter`,
`pro`, or `enterprise`. We want to update our User in the database to give the
right amount of access to the customer.

If we go with the `customer.subscription.deleted` event, this works the same
way. We want to update the subscription status to be `cancelled` which will be
the subscription's status on the event data we receive. That should
successfully cancel that user's access.

Our application uses Stripe Checkout to start the subscription. In the webhook
handler, you'll notice the `checkout.session.completed` event type is already
implemented. When Stripe Checkout is used to start the subscription and we want
to update the user's subscription status to active.

Try signing up and notice that when you register, you're redirected to Stripe
Checkout, you can go through the payment flow with the `4242424242424242` card
and subscribe the test customer to the Starter plan. When you're redirected
back, you'll see that the checkout session was handled, and we have the
subscription status updated to `active`. We also see that we are now subscribed
to "Starter." Click on manage billing and change from starter to pro from the
customer portal and ensure that change takes effect in your application.

Note you're charged for the upgrade. You can see the status updated in the
demo.

Sometimes webhooks are delivered immediately; sometimes they will arrive before
the local browser can refresh. You'll want to provision and de-provision based
on webhooks because the retry logic for webhooks is more reliable.

Experiment with more upgrades and downgrades and ultimately attempt to cancel.
